      <p> Hello everyone my name is Adel Gage. I am a junior this year at the University of Rhode Island studying Applied Mathematics. I am from Houston, Texas and
    came to URI to play on the volleyball team. I love living by the ocean and hope to live in the city when I graduate. In pass time I enjoy reading, hanging out 
    with family and friends, drinking coffee, and art! I am very friendly but also love some quality alone time to think to myself. </p>
